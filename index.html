            <p>Hello! My name is Prince Chidera Dike and I live in Ibadan, Nigeria. I am a Certified Content Marketer. I am also a tech and template maven. I love to analyze different technologies (web3, Artificial Intelligence and various software tools). With over five years of experience writing content for B2B tech and SaaS companies, I have learned to slice through jargon and deliver messaging that hits the mark ðŸŽ¯ I use my experience, research and expert outreach to create tech product guides, templates, and checklists to make work faster for my clients. I am presently enrolled as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University Idaho Online (B.Sc. Software Development) where I'm learning how to build and deploy software to solve business problems in an ever-advancing world.</p>
